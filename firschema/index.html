  # FIR Transit Schema Logic

  ## What is this document?

  This is documentation of the logic required to produce an NBN 10.1 FIR Report.
  The document assumes schema version 1.2.  It is recommended to use a webkit browser
  to allow access to the interactive schema and example data.

  ## How to use this document?

  Each field viewable in the FIR has a section dedicated to it in this document.
  Each field has some logic defined in javascript that will then generate the desired results.
  Each section documents the logic and the results.

  The logic itself was written in Coffeescript.  Coffeescript is a more powerful and human readable language
  that compiles down to javascript.  The Coffeescript is viewable by clicking the link titled "Source Code Used to Generated Result".
  It is recommended to use the coffeescript code as instruction as opposed to the compiled Javascript.

  ##Why preview the Javascript instead of the Coffeescript.
  To do so would require manually copying the business logic into a string and writing that string to the page.
  This is why Javascript is shown within the document, as it can be displayed dynamically.

  ##What is the Interactive Schema and Example Data
  To ensure the code documented is reliable, all functions reference the schema as JSON.
  You can access this JSON by opening the developer console (`F12` on Chrome) and typing in `codedValues` and `old_conduit` respectively.
  Try it now.
  
  This will give you access to Javascript objects representing the schema.
